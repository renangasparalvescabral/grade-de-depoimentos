                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br>
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12<br>
                weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve<br>
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

              recommended!</h1>
            <p> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br>
              never written a line of code. I needed<br>
              some structure from professionals<br>
              who can help me learn programming<br>
              step by step. I was encouraged to<br>
              enroll by a former student of theirs<br>
              who can only say wonderful things<br>
              about the program. The entire<br>
              curriculum and staff did not<br>
              disappoint. They were very hands-on<br>
              and I never had to wait long for<br>
              assistance. The agile team project, in<br>
              particular, was outstanding. It took<br>
              my learning to the next level in a way<br> 
              that no tutorial could ever have. In<br>
              fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br>
              interviews as an example of my<br>
              developent experience. It certainly<br>
              helped me land a job as a full-stack<br>
              developer after receiving multiple<br>
              offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
